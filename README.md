# DIGITAL STUDENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM  (QR CODE BASED) MUSTID

## üìñ Overview

The Smart Student identification System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the collection,
storage, and retrieval of student data. It enables administrators to efficiently upload student details‚Äîincluding personal
information and photographs‚Äîwhile generating unique QR codes for each student record. The system integrates cloud-based image
storage for optimal performance and ease of maintenance.The system employs Node.js-based RESTful API designed for handling secure 
student identity records. It accepts image uploads, stores student details in MongoDB using Mongoose, and encrypts/decrypts sensitive QR code data 
with Cloudinary integration for image hosting in the cloud.
